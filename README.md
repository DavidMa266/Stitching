#Stitching

We are working on creating a program that creates modern art out of images of nano-scale structures.

Beautiful.
Modern Art Piece Exhibit B

Modern Art Piece Exhibit C

It's so deep I can't even

###To Do
1. Being able to read .avi files
2. Optimize with GPU's and concurrency
3. Cleaning code up/better/more documentation
4. Actually stitching the images together.


###Compiling/Running
For src/traversers, main is in ImageLoader.java. It takes in an argument, which is the name of the file you want to process.
